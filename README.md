# Avenue Code UI Challenge - Part I #

## Quick start ##

Run `npm install` to install the application dependences

Run `npm start` to start a dev server, them navigate to  `http://localhost:4200/`.
Obs. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests.

Run `npm run build`to prepare a deploy package of application.


## libraries useds ##

I thought to use a small library as Polymer because the application isn't very large but I chose the Angular because I have more experience with it and is more easy to make unit tests.

### JS libraries ###
* Angular(Current stable version)

### CSS libraries ###
* Bootstrap 4

### Test libraries ###
* Karma
* Jasmine

## Special Mentions ##
I don't used the angular-cli to generate the project only to build and serve, can you check my commits history.
